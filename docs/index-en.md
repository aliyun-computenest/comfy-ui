## Overview

ComfyUI is the most powerful open-source node-based generative AI application, supporting the creation of images, videos, and audio content. Leveraging cutting-edge open-source models, it enables video and image generation.

According to the official documentation, ComfyUI features:

+ **Node/Graph/Flowchart Interface** - Experiment and create complex Stable Diffusion workflows without writing any code
+ **Full Support** for SD1.x, SD2.x, and SDXL
+ **Asynchronous Queue System**
+ **Multiple Optimizations** - Only re-executes parts of the workflow that changed between executions
+ **Command Line Options** - `--lowvram` enables running on GPUs with less than 3GB memory (automatically enabled on low-memory GPUs)
+ **CPU Support** - Works even without GPU using `--cpu` (slower)
+ **Model Loading** - Supports ckpt, safetensors, and diffusers models/checkpoints. Standalone VAE and CLIP models
+ **Embeddings/Textual Inversion**
+ **LoRAs** (regular, locon, and loha)
+ **Hypernetworks**
+ **Workflow Loading** - Load complete workflows from generated PNG files (including seeds)
+ **JSON Export/Import** - Save/load workflows as JSON files
+ **Complex Workflows** - Node interface for creating complex workflows like "Hires fix" or more advanced workflows
+ **Area Composition**
+ **Inpainting** - Using regular and inpainting models
+ **ControlNet and T2I Adapters**
+ **Upscaling Models** (ESRGAN, ESRGAN variants, SwinIR, Swin2SR, etc.)
+ **unCLIP Models**
+ **GLIGEN**
+ **Model Merging**
+ **Latent Previews** using TAESD
+ **Fast Startup**
+ **Fully Offline** - Downloads nothing
+ **Configuration Files** for setting model search paths
